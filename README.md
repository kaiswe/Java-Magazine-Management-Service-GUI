# Java-Magazine-Management-Service-GUI
Java based web client that enhances the previous Java magazine service to now include an interactive GUI

This application's web client is to provide an appropriate web page to the user, through HTML and JavaScript implementations, 
that will collect the user’s full name, phone number (with any prefix codes), birth date, and favourite pastime (limited to a selective set of options), which then sends all entered information off to a server.

This application's server architecure works asynchronously to instantiate a personalized online weekly magazine, 4 magazine supplements, a list of paying and associate customers, their personal details, supplement subscriptions, and all relative pricing/billing information. 
The program processes all the magazine and customer data, interconnecting appropriate information – such as a paying customers linked associates, or how many supplement subscriptions a customer is subscribed to. Once all data is processed, and on request, the program can output any information regarding the magazine service, such as, all the magazine’s
supplements, all customers stored within the system or all monthly emails detailing a paying customers monthly subscription bill. The program can also remove or add any customer to or from the magazine service, at any time. It is assumed though, that a customer’s
supplement interest, is also a supplement they are subscribed to, and all customers receive an email every week detailing their supplement subscriptions, where on the final week of the month paying customers receive two emails – the first being the weekly email, and the second detailing their end of month billing breakdown.
